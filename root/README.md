## Installation (Frontend + Backend)

First, run npm install command in the root directory so that concurrently will be installed in your repository.

```
npm install
```

After, installation is done then run npm install-dependencies command so that all the front-end and back-end dependencies will be installed. It might take while to install all packages so be patient.

```
npm run install-dependencies
```
